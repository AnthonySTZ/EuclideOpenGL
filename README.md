Euclide is a node-based 3D engine currently in development.

## Nodes

Current working nodes: (I will add more over time)
- Cube
- Transform
- Null

## Viewport

You can move with your mouse buttons (pan, zoom, orbit) in the scene.
Yo can also press F to recenter the camera to the object.

## Parameters

When you select a node, there is a parameters tab that open.
You can change parameters value !

## Geometry System

I decided to use a half-edge data structure to store mesh data.
