# Euclide WIP

Euclide is a node-based 3D engine currently in development.
At this point only the rendering part works, I'm working on the node graph system. 

## Rendering

You can move with your mouse buttons (pan, zoom, orbit) in the scene.

## Geometry System

I decided to use a half-edge data structure to store mesh data.
