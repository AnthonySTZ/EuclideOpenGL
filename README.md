Euclide is a node-based 3D engine currently in development.

## Nodes

Current working nodes: (I will add more over time)<br/>

You can create new Node by right clicking on the graph (a dropdown list will appear).<br/>
You can cut node connections by holding the 'Y' key and draging on the connection.<br/>
You can delete nodes by selecting it and press 'Delete'.<br/>

## Viewport

You can move with your mouse buttons (pan, zoom, orbit) in the scene.<br/>
There are some shortcuts :<br/>
- **F** to recenter the camera to the object.<br/>
- **G** to toogle the **grid** visibility.<br/>
- **W** to toogle the **wireframe** visibility.<br/>
- **P** to toogle the **polygons** visibility.<br/>
- **V** to toogle the **vertex** visibility.<br/>

## Parameters

When you select a node, there is a parameters tab that open.<br/>
You can change parameters value !
